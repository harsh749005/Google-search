In this project I learnt about how to manipulate url using javascript . 

👉location.href = "url" is the one way to work on this but I used
 window.open("url",'_blank', 'noopener, noreferrer'') object because it allows to open the url into new page and also provide protecttion from attacks ('noopener, noreferrer');
